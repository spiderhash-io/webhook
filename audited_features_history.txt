1. HTTP webhook forwarding (`HTTPWebhookModule`) – audited for SSRF, header injection/smuggling, URL validation, timeout/error handling, and security test coverage; final risk rated Low after fixes and alignment with tests.
2. `/stats` endpoint authentication & access control – audited for token-based auth, IP whitelist and rate limiting behavior, including new tests exercising misconfigured/missing tokens, spoofed IPs via `X-Forwarded-For`, and rate limit enforcement; final risk rated Low assuming secure production configuration of environment variables.
3. OAuth2 webhook authentication (`OAuth2Validator`) – audited for JWT algorithm confusion, `none` algorithm, issuer/audience/expiry handling, scope enforcement, SSRF via token introspection endpoints, and DoS via oversized tokens; no code or tests were changed and final risk is rated Low assuming sane configuration and standard HTTP header/time‑limit controls.
4. JWT webhook authentication (`JWTValidator`) – audited for algorithm confusion and `none` algorithm, weak algorithm use, issuer/audience/expiry and scope validation, header manipulation, timing/DoS behavior (large or deeply nested payloads), and error-message leakage; existing unit/security tests already cover these attack vectors, no new tests or code changes were required, and final risk is rated Low assuming non-empty secrets and sensible JWT config.
5. HMAC webhook authentication (`HMACValidator`) – audited for header spoofing, signature format tricks (prefixes, hex validation, whitespace), timing attacks, body tampering, DoS via large bodies, replay-style patterns, and secret exposure in errors; comprehensive unit and integration tests already exercise these vectors, no new tests or code changes were required, and final risk is rated Low assuming non-empty secrets and appropriate per-webhook HMAC configuration.
6. IP-based access control (`IPWhitelistValidator`) – audited for IP spoofing via `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP`, trusted proxy handling, header injection/newlines/null bytes, normalization and comparison of IPv4/IPv6 addresses, error logging, and end-to-end behavior via the webhook and `/stats` endpoints; extensive unit and integration tests already cover these attack vectors, no new tests or code changes were required, and final risk is rated Low assuming correct `trusted_proxies` and whitelist configuration in production.
7. S3 webhook storage (`S3Module`) – audited for S3 object key/path traversal, dangerous characters and injection patterns in prefixes and filename patterns, null/control characters, excessive key lengths, and S3 error handling; existing unit and integration tests already cover these vectors, no new tests or code changes were required, and final risk is rated Low assuming safe S3 bucket configuration and credentials management.
8. Rate limiting (`RateLimiter` and `RateLimitValidator`) – audited for sliding-window logic correctness, per-webhook and per-key isolation, concurrent request handling, endpoint-level enforcement (webhook and `/stats`), and rate-limit headers/retry-after behavior; unit and integration tests already cover over-limit blocking, sliding windows, concurrency, per-webhook limits, and HTTP 429 responses, so no new tests or code changes were required, and final risk is rated Low assuming sensible configured limits.
9. Retry handler (`RetryHandler`) – audited for DoS via unbounded retry attempts, excessive delays, exponential backoff overflow, configuration injection (negative/zero/invalid values), error classification bypass, and default retryable behavior for unknown errors; added comprehensive security validation with limits (MAX_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT=20, MAX_DELAY_LIMIT=60s, MAX_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER=10.0), changed default behavior to fail-safe (unknown errors non-retryable), and added 14 new security tests; final risk rated Low after fixes.
